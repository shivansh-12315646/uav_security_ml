# Netlify Environment Variables Example
# Copy these to your Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
# For static site deployment, most variables are optional

# Optional: Backend API URL if deploying full Flask app separately
# API_URL=https://your-backend-api.render.com

# Optional: Production environment flag
# NODE_ENV=production
# PYTHON_VERSION=3.10

# Note: The Netlify static site doesn't require database, Redis, or other backend services
# These are only needed if you deploy the full Flask application to another platform

# For full application deployment, see .env.example and DEPLOYMENT.md
